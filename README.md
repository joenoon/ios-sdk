The next version of the SDK will also provide a drop-in user facing invite flow. [Read more about that on our blog.](http://blog.yesgraph.com/perfect-share-flow/) 

## Requirements

The SDK is compatible with iOS apps with **Minimum Deployment Target** iOS 8 and above. It requires Xcode 7.x and  iOS 9 SDK to build the source.

## Integration

The easiest way to integrate is with CocoaPods. Add the following Pod to your **Podfile**:

```

An alternate way to integrate is using Carthage. Add the following link to your **CartFile**:

Or integrate it manually by drag & dropping all files from YesGraphSDK folder into your project. If you have a Swift project, you must add `YesGraph.h` file to your Objective-C Bridging Header.
