# YesGraph iOS SDK - Getting Started

YesGraph iOS SDK makes it easy to add invite flows to your app and helps your app grow.

##What YesGraph does for you

Boosts the performance of sharing and invite flows by recommending exactly who users should invite. We use machine learning and social graph analysis to tailor results just for your product and users.

**How YesGraph Works**: YesGraph can recommend who each user should invite. We tune our ranking by learning about past users and past invites. Then you send a userâ€™s contacts, and we send back a ranked list.

##Base YesGraph iOS SDK classes so you can leverage the API with ease

###YSGClient
**YSGClient** provides direct API access to YesGraph API which needs to be configured with your **YesGraph clientKey**.
Because YesGraph treats mobile devices as untrusted clients, first you need a trusted backend to generate client keys.

###YSGLocalContactSource
**YSGLocalContactSource** is a wrapper class that handles all the logic from requesting permission to users address book to fetching local contact list.

There are two steps when requesting permissions for users address book. First a custom alert view is show where developers can configure the title and message that is shown to the user.

*Objective-C*
```objective-c
YSGLocalContactSource *localContactSource = [[YSGLocalContactSource alloc] init];
localContactSource.contactAccessPromptTitle = @"Access prompt title";
localContactSource.contactAccessPromptMessage = @"Access prompt message";
```

*Swift*
```swift
let localContactSource = YSGLocalContactSource()
localContactSource.contactAccessPromptTitle = @"Access prompt title"
localContactSource.contactAccessPromptMessage = "Access prompt message"
```

###YSGCacheContactSource
**YSGCacheContactSource** if configured 

###YSGOnlineContactSource
**YSGOnlineContactSource** is a wrapper class that handles fetching and syncing contact list to YesGraph API.

YSGOnlineContactSource is configured with `YSGClient` object, `YSGLocalContactSource` object and optionally `YSGCacheContactSource` which handles caching of contact list retrived from the YesGraph API.

Also a **user ID** must be set for the `YSGOnlineContactSource`. If user is not known, you can generate a random user ID by using `YSGUtility` class and `randomUserId` method.

*Objective-C*
```objective-c
YSGOnlineContactSource *onlineContactSource = [[YSGOnlineContactSource alloc] initWithClient:client localSource:localContactSource cacheSource:[YSGCacheContactSource new]];
onlineContactSource.userId = userId;
```

*Swift*
```swift
let onlineContactSource = YSGOnlineContactSource(client: client, localSource: localContactSource, cacheSource: YSGCacheContactSource())
onlineContactSource.userId = userId
```


##Using YesGraph SDK suggestions and contact list with custom UI

1. Configure **YSGLocalContactSource**

	*Objective-C*
	```objective-c
	YSGLocalContactSource *localContactSource = [[YSGLocalContactSource alloc] init];
    localContactSource.contactAccessPromptMessage = @"Share contacts with MyApp to invite friends?";
    ```
    *Swift*
	```swift
	let localContactSource = YSGLocalContactSource()
    localContactSource.contactAccessPromptMessage = "Share contacts with MyApp to invite friends?"
	```

2. Configure **YSGClient** with received **client key**

	*Objective-C*
	```objective-c
	YSGClient *client = [[YSGClient alloc] init];
	client.clientKey = clientKey;
	```
	*Swift*
	```swift
	let client = YSGClient()
	client.clientKey = clientKey
	```

3. Configure **YSGOnlineContactSource** with your **user ID**

	*Objective-C*
	```objective-c
	YSGOnlineContactSource *onlineContactSource = [[YSGOnlineContactSource alloc] initWithClient:client localSource:localContactSource cacheSource:[YSGCacheContactSource new]];
    onlineContactSource.userId = userId;
	```
	*Swift*
	```swift
	let onlineContactSource = YSGOnlineContactSource(client: client, localSource: localContactSource, cacheSource: YSGCacheContactSource())
   	onlineContactSource.userId = userId
	```

3. Fetch user's contactList with configured **YSGOnlineContactSource**

	*Objective-C*
	```objective-c
	[onlineContactSource requestContactPermission:^(BOOL granted, NSError *error) {
        if (granted) {
            NSLog(@"contact permission granted");
            [onlineContactSource fetchContactListWithCompletion:^(YSGContactList *contactList, NSError *error) {
            	if (!error) {
                    NSLog(@"contact list fetched");
                    NSArray<YSGContact *> *suggestedContacts = [contactList suggestedEntriesWithNumberOfSuggestions:YSGDefaultInviteNumberOfSuggestions];
                    //display suggested contacts and contact list with your custom UI
                }
            }];
        }
    }];
	```
	*Swift*
	```swift
	onlineContactSource.fetchContactListWithCompletion { (contactList, error) -> Void in
		if  !error {
			print("contact list fetched")
			let suggestedContacts = contactList?.suggestedEntriesWithNumberOfSuggestions(YSGDefaultInviteNumberOfSuggestions)
			//display suggested contacts and contact list with your custom UI
		}
   	}
	```
4. Every time the suggestions list is shown it must be sent to the **YesGraph API** via **YSGOnlineContactSource**

	*Objective-C*
	```objective-c
	[onlineContactSource sendShownSuggestions:suggestedContacts];
	```
	*Swift*
	```swift
	onlineContactSource.sendShownSuggestions(suggestedContacts)
	```
