# Getting Started

YesGraph iOS SDK makes it easy to add invite flows to your app and helps your app grow. This document describes basic elements of the SDK and what are they used for.

## What YesGraph does for you

Boosts the performance of sharing and invite flows by recommending exactly who users should invite. We use machine learning and social graph analysis to tailor results just for your product and users.

**How YesGraph Works**: YesGraph can recommend who each user should invite. We tune our ranking by learning about past users and past invites. Then you send a userâ€™s contacts, and we send back a ranked list.
